Game of Life Explanation
     The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. 
It is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.
     This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970.
It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. 
Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.
     Game of life 2.0 has some modifications:
     - Grey borders that isn't gonna change
     - In thecenter of in it is a flower
     - Green represents the living 
     
Rules:
 1 Each cell no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.

 2 Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
 
 3 Each cell with one, two or three neighbors survives.
 
 4  Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
