     - Grey borders that isn't gonna change
     - In thecenter of in it is a flower
     - Green represents the living

 2 Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
 
 3 Each cell with one, two or three neighbors survives.
 
 4  Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
